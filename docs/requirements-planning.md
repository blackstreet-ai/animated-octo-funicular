# AI Cinematic Conversion Platform - Requirements & Planning

## Vision & Objectives

### Vision
To create a web-based SaaS application that empowers creative professionals, independent filmmakers, and digital artists to transform written narratives into visual storyboards and video content through AI-powered image and video generation.

### Objectives
1. Provide an intuitive platform for text-to-image and image-to-video conversion
2. Implement a tiered subscription model with defined conversion quotas
3. Deliver a responsive, accessible UI with modern design principles
4. Enable basic post-conversion editing capabilities
5. Facilitate social sharing of generated content
6. Ensure scalable, asynchronous processing for conversions

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Independent filmmakers, digital storytellers, video content creators, social media influencers, digital artists
- **Secondary**: Production studios (for prototyping), educational institutions

## Core Features

### 1. Text-to-Image Conversion
- Text input with parameter selection (styles, filters, aspect ratios)
- Integration with Fal Provider AI SDK
- Asynchronous processing with status updates

### 2. Image-to-Video Assembly
- Automatic compilation of generated images into video sequences
- Asynchronous processing with real-time status updates

### 3. Project Management
- Dashboard with simple list view of user projects
- Preview capabilities for generated content
- Basic editing/fine-tuning options

### 4. User Authentication & Subscription Management
- Integration with Clerk for authentication
- Subscription tiers with defined conversion limits:
  - Free: 20 conversions/month
  - Basic: 200 conversions/month
  - Pro: 400 conversions/month
- Enforcement of conversion quotas

### 5. Social Sharing
- Direct integration for sharing on social platforms
- Generation of shareable links

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router) for server-side rendering and routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component library
