# AI Cinematic Conversion Platform - Architecture & Design

## Application Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js App Router**: Using the latest App Router pattern for routing and server components
- **React Server Components (RSC)**: Leveraging server components for improved performance and reduced client-side JavaScript
- **Client Components**: Used only when necessary for interactivity, state management, or browser APIs
- **Component Structure**: Following a modular, component-driven approach with clear separation of concerns

### Backend Architecture
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for handling API requests
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user authentication and session management
- **Database**: Neon Serverless Postgres with Drizzle ORM for data modeling and queries
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Queue-based system for handling conversion tasks

### Data Flow
1. User submits text for conversion
2. Request is validated and authenticated
3. Conversion job is queued for processing
4. Fal Provider AI SDK processes the conversion asynchronously
5. Results are stored and made available to the user
6. User can view, edit, and share the generated content

## Database Schema

### Users Table
- Managed by Clerk, with additional metadata stored in our database
- Tracks subscription tier and usage metrics

### Projects Table
- Stores information about user projects
- Contains references to generated images and videos
- Includes metadata about conversion parameters and settings

### Conversions Table
- Tracks individual conversion jobs
- Stores status, timestamps, and results
- Links to associated projects

### Subscriptions Table
- Manages subscription tiers and quotas
- Tracks usage and renewal dates

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `/api/auth/*` - Handled by Clerk

### Conversions
- `/api/conversions` - Create and manage conversion jobs
- `/api/conversions/[id]` - Get, update, or delete a specific conversion
- `/api/conversions/[id]/status` - Check the status of a conversion job

### Projects
- `/api/projects` - Create and manage projects
- `/api/projects/[id]` - Get, update, or delete a specific project
- `/api/projects/[id]/share` - Generate sharing links for a project

### Subscriptions
- `/api/subscriptions` - Manage user subscriptions
- `/api/subscriptions/usage` - Check current usage and limits

## UI Components

### Layout Components
- `Header` - Main navigation and user menu
- `Footer` - Site footer with links and information
- `Sidebar` - Navigation sidebar for dashboard views
- `Layout` - Main layout wrapper for consistent page structure

### Page-Specific Components
- `Dashboard` - Project listing and usage statistics
- `ConversionForm` - Form for submitting text and parameters for conversion
- `ProjectDetail` - Detailed view of a project with editing capabilities
- `ProjectGallery` - Grid view of project images and videos
- `SubscriptionPlans` - Display of available subscription tiers

### UI Components
- Buttons, inputs, selectors, and other form elements
- Cards, modals, and dialogs
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states and progress indicators

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- Clerk for secure authentication and identity management
- Support for various login methods (email/password, social logins)
- Secure session management and token handling

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Resource-based permissions for user content
- Subscription tier enforcement for feature access

## Asynchronous Processing

### Conversion Queue
- Jobs are queued for processing to handle high load
- Status updates are provided to users in real-time
- Failed jobs are retried with appropriate backoff strategies

### Notification System
- Users are notified when conversions are complete
- Email notifications for important events (optional)
- In-app notifications for real-time updates

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Graceful handling of API errors with user-friendly messages
- Fallback UI components for loading and error states

### Server-Side Errors
- Structured error responses from API endpoints
- Logging of errors for monitoring and debugging
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading for improved page load times
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Server components to reduce client-side JavaScript

### Monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting
- Usage analytics for feature optimization

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Secure storage of user data and generated content
- HTTPS for all communications
- Proper handling of sensitive information

### Input Validation
- Validation of all user inputs using Zod
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Environment-specific configuration variables
- Feature flags for controlled rollout of new features

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing and deployment
- Version control and release management
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments
